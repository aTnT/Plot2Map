# PlotToMap
Plot-to-map comparison of aboveground biomass workflow

Here we develop an automated processing chain of AGB plot and map comparison in the context of map validation of AGB map products. The workflow mainly includes preprocessing of forest inventory data and estimating plot-level uncertainties (measurement and allometric model errors, sampling/within-pixel errors, and temporal mismatch with the map year). Preprocessed plot data are also format-ready for calibration/AGB mapping.
