# PlotToMap
Plot-to-map comparison of aboveground biomass workflow

Here we develop an automated processing chain of AGB plot and map comparison intended for local and global AGB validation (and even for calibration/AGB mapping). It includes preprocessing of forest inventory data and estimating plot-level uncertainties (measurement and allometric model errors, sampling/within-pixel errors, and temporal mismatch with the map year).
