\title{Create a square polygon (block) based on input coordinates and size}
\usage{
MakeBlockPolygon(x, y, size)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric. The x-coordinate (longitude) of a point within the desired block.}

\item{y}{Numeric. The y-coordinate (latitude) of a point within the desired block.}

\item{size}{Numeric. The size (side length) of the square block in the same units as the
input coordinates (e.g., degrees for longitude/latitude).}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object representing the square polygon. The polygon is created in the
WGS 84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326).
}
\description{
This function creates a square polygon (block) centered around the input coordinates.
The block is aligned to a grid defined by the \code{size} parameter, with the lower-left corner
of the block calculated based on the input coordinates. The resulting polygon is returned
as an \code{sf} object.
}
\details{
The function calculates the lower-left corner of the block by aligning the input coordinates
to a grid defined by the \code{size} parameter. For example:
\itemize{
\item If \code{x = 5.2}, \code{y = 10.7}, and \code{size = 1}, the lower-left corner will be at \verb{(5, 10)}.
\item The block will extend from \verb{(5, 10)} to \verb{(6, 11)}.
\item If \code{x = 5.2}, \code{y = 10.7}, and \code{size = 0.1}, the lower-left corner will be at \verb{(5.1, 10.6)}.
\item The block will extend from \verb{(5.1, 10.6)} to \verb{(5.2, 10.7)}.
}

The polygon is created with vertices in the following order:
\enumerate{
\item Lower-left corner \verb{(xll, yll)}
\item Lower-right corner \verb{(xll + size, yll)}
\item Upper-right corner \verb{(xll + size, yll + size)}
\item Upper-left corner \verb{(xll, yll + size)}
\item Lower-left corner \verb{(xll, yll)} (to close the polygon)
}

The resulting polygon is returned as an \code{sf} object with a WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate
reference system.

\examples{
# Create a 1x1 degree block including the point (5.2, 10.7) aligned to a 1x1 degree grid:
block <- MakeBlockPolygon(5.2, 10.7, 1)
print(block)
plot(block)
# Create a 0.25x0.25 degree block including the point (5.2, 10.7) aligned to a 0.25x0.25 degree grid:
block2 <- MakeBlockPolygon(5.2, 10.7, 0.25)
print(block2)
sf::st_centroid(block2)
