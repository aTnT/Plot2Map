}
\arguments{
\item{sd_raster}{SpatRaster containing pixel-level standard deviation of AGB (Mg/ha).
Must have same extent and resolution as the AGB map.}

\item{variogram_model}{A discountedVariogram object from \code{discountVariogram()},
or a gstat vgm object containing the fitted (and optionally discounted) variogram
parameters. Used to create the spatial correlation matrix.}

\item{resolution}{Numeric. Resolution (in degrees or CRS units) for aggregation.
Default: 0.1 (roughly 10 km at equator). Defines the window size for focal
aggregation. Should match the scale of regional reporting units.}

\item{forest_mask}{Optional SpatRaster with forest/non-forest mask. Only forest
pixels (mask > 0) will be included in aggregation. Default: NULL (all pixels used).}

\item{filename}{Optional. File path to save aggregated SD raster. Default: NULL
(raster kept in memory).}

\item{return_comparison}{Logical. Should comparison statistics (with vs. without
correlation) be calculated? Default: TRUE. Useful for assessing the impact of
spatial correlation on regional uncertainty.}

\item{scale_factor}{Numeric. Conversion factor from pixel units to regional totals.
Default: 10000 (converts 100m pixels to hectares when using 0.1° aggregation).
Used to scale SD from mean per-pixel values to regional total values.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages? Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with class "aggregatedUncertainty" containing:
\describe{
\item{aggregated_sd_raster}{SpatRaster with aggregated SD values accounting
for spatial correlation (Mg)}
\item{sd_no_correlation}{SpatRaster with aggregated SD assuming independence
(Mg). Only if return_comparison=TRUE}
\item{correlation_matrix}{Matrix used for focal window correlation weighting}
\item{regional_sd_correlated}{Numeric. Total regional SD accounting for
correlation (Mg)}
\item{regional_sd_independent}{Numeric. Total regional SD assuming independence
(Mg). Only if return_comparison=TRUE}
\item{correlation_reduction_factor}{Numeric. Ratio of correlated to independent
SD. Values < 1 indicate spatial correlation reduces total uncertainty.
Only if return_comparison=TRUE}
\item{n_cells}{Integer. Number of cells included in aggregation}
\item{resolution}{Numeric. Aggregation resolution used}
}
}
\description{
Aggregates pixel-level standard deviation to regional scale while accounting for
spatial correlation using a variogram-based correlation matrix. This is critical
for accurate uncertainty quantification as ignoring spatial correlation leads to
underestimation of regional-scale uncertainty.
}
\details{
This function implements the focal window correlation approach from Section 5 of
the Mexico demo notebook (lines 1215-1305). The workflow is:

\enumerate{
\item Create correlation matrix from variogram using \code{corMatrix()} helper
\item Apply forest mask if provided
\item Use \code{terra::focal()} with correlation matrix as weights
\item Calculate weighted sum: sum(SD_i * SD_j * cor_ij)
\item Take square root to get aggregated SD
\item Scale to regional totals using scale_factor
}

\strong{Spatial correlation and aggregation:}

When aggregating uncertainty from pixels to regions, we must account for spatial
correlation. The variance of a sum of correlated variables is:

\deqn{Var(\sum X_i) = \sum_i \sum_j SD_i \times SD_j \times \rho_{ij}}{Var(sum X_i) = sum_i sum_j SD_i * SD_j * rho_ij}

If correlation is ignored (independence assumption), this reduces to:

\deqn{Var(\sum X_i) = \sum_i SD_i^2}{Var(sum X_i) = sum_i SD_i^2}

Positive spatial correlation increases regional variance compared to the
independence assumption, because nearby pixels tend to have errors in the same
direction.

\strong{Correlation matrix:}

The correlation matrix is created from the variogram using the helper function
\code{corMatrix()}, which converts semivariance γ(h) to correlation ρ(h):

\deqn{\rho(h) = 1 - \gamma(h) / sill}{rho(h) = 1 - gamma(h) / sill}

This matrix defines the correlation weights for the focal window aggregation.

\strong{Resolution and scale:}

The resolution parameter should match your reporting units (e.g., 0.1° for regional
estimates, 1° for country-level). The scale_factor converts from pixel-level SD
to regional total SD based on pixel size and aggregation area.
