\title{Determine plot data type from structure and columns}
\usage{
determineDataType(plot_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_data}{A data frame containing plot data}
}
\value{
Character string indicating the plot data type: "tree_level", "point", "polygon", "nested", or "lidar"
}
\description{
This helper function identifies the type of plot data based on its structure and available columns.
It performs a series of checks in the following priority order:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item Checks if data is an sf object (classifies as "polygon")
\item Checks for column names indicating nested plot structure
\item Checks for complex IDs or GUIDs in ID columns that suggest nested structure
\item Checks for processed tree-level data with AGB and standard deviation
\item Checks for raw tree data with standard column names
\item Checks for non-standard tree data based on column name patterns
\item Checks for LiDAR indicators like "cv" or "raster" columns
\item Defaults to "point" type if no other type is detected
}
