\title{Global Reference Dataset for Above-Ground Biomass (AGBref)}
\format{
\subsection{\code{AGBref}}{

A data frame containing global reference AGB measurements:
\describe{
\item{POINT_X}{Longitude of the grid cell centroid.}
\item{POINT_Y}{Latitude of the grid cell centroid.}
\item{TC_PLT_SD}{Standard deviation of tree cover (\%) at the plot locations within the grid cell, based on remote sensing, is used to assess variability in plot representativeness.}
\item{TC_PLT_MEAN}{Mean tree cover (\%) at the plot locations within the grid cell.}
\item{TC_GRID_SD}{Standard deviation of tree cover (\%) at the entire grid cell (not just at plot locations).}
\item{TC_GRID_MEAN}{Mean tree cover (\%) at the grid cell level, derived from satellite data (e.g., Global Forest Change dataset).}
\item{n}{Number of plots used within the grid cell to compute biomass estimates.}
\item{AGB_T_HA}{Harmonized above-ground biomass (in tons per hectare, T/ha) at the grid cell level. Adjusted for forest area definition, temporal mismatch, and other preprocessing steps.}
\item{SIZE_HA}{Total plot area within the grid cell in hectares.}
\item{OPEN}{Indicator for openness of data.}
\item{VER}{Denotes versioning or verification status. To be updated when new versions are released.}
\item{varTot}{Total variance of AGB within the grid cell. Accounts for the spatial-scale mismatch considering the target grid cell and associated measurement-related (tree measurement, allometric model use) uncertainties.}
\item{AVG_YEAR}{Average year of plot measurement for plots within the grid cell. Useful for matching map epochs (e.g., 2005, 2010, etc.).}
\item{BIO}{Biome category of the grid cell, e.g., "Tropical rainforest", "Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests". Derived from ecological zone datasets.}
\item{CODE}{Source code of the dataset provider. Example: AUS1 for Australia-based NFI. Refer to supplementary table in the manuscript.}
\item{INVENTORY}{Type or scale of data source, e.g., regional, national, or local.}

\description{
This dataset is part of the AGBref initiative, a global reference dataset for above-ground
biomass (AGB) validation derived from national forest inventories (NFIs), permanent research
plots, and local airborne LiDAR-based maps. It contains harmonized AGB estimates across multiple
spatial resolutions and epochs, together with associated uncertainties and ecological metadata.
It is primarily intended to support the validation of satellite-derived global biomass maps and
national carbon accounting.

\note{
This should be considered a version 0 and will immediately updated with a more
comprehensive version alongside peer review process of the data descriptor paper.
