\title{Discount Variogram Nugget for Plot Measurement Error}
\usage{
discountVariogram(
  variogram_fit,
  plot_data,
  filter_iqr = TRUE,
  iqr_mult = 1.5,
  transfer_negative = TRUE,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variogram_fit}{A residualVariogram object from \code{fitResidualVariogram()},
or a gstat vgm object to be discounted.}

\item{plot_data}{A data.frame with plot-level variance estimates. Must contain
columns: \code{varPlot} (plot measurement variance in (Mg/ha)²) and
\code{varMap} (map pixel variance in (Mg/ha)²). Typically obtained from
\code{calculateTotalUncertainty()} or similar.}

\item{filter_iqr}{Logical. Should plots be filtered by IQR to remove extreme
variance ratios? Default: TRUE. Christensen (2011) recommends this to avoid
bias from outliers.}

\item{iqr_mult}{Numeric. IQR multiplier for outlier detection. Default: 1.5.
Plots with varPlot/varMap² outside the range
\code{[Q1 - iqr_mult * IQR, Q3 + iqr_mult * IQR]} are removed.}

\item{transfer_negative}{Logical. Should negative nugget values be transferred to
the partial sill? Default: TRUE. Prevents invalid variogram models when
discounting reduces nugget below zero.}

\item{plot}{Logical. Should a comparison plot be generated? Default: TRUE. Shows
original vs. discounted variogram models.}
}
\value{
A list with class "discountedVariogram" containing:
\describe{
\item{discounted_variogram}{gstat vgm object with adjusted nugget}
\item{original_variogram}{gstat vgm object before discounting}
\item{discount_factor}{Numeric. The discount value subtracted from nugget:
mean(varPlot / varMap²)}
\item{nugget_original}{Numeric. Nugget before discounting}
\item{nugget_discounted}{Numeric. Nugget after discounting (≥ 0)}
\item{nugget_transferred}{Numeric. Amount transferred to partial sill if
nugget would have been negative}
\item{n_plots}{Integer. Number of plots used in calculation}
\item{n_filtered}{Integer. Number of plots removed by IQR filtering}
\item{plot}{Function to generate comparison plot if plot=TRUE, NULL otherwise}

}
\description{
Adjusts the variogram nugget to account for plot-level measurement uncertainty
using the method of Christensen (2011). This is essential for proper uncertainty
quantification as it separates spatial variation (which aggregates differently)
from measurement error (which does not).
}
\details{
This function implements the variogram discounting method from Christensen (2011)
as applied in Section 5 of the Mexico demo notebook (lines 1177-1213).

\strong{Christensen (2011) method:}

The variogram nugget includes both true micro-scale spatial variation and plot
measurement error. To isolate spatial variation, we calculate:

\deqn{discount = mean(varPlot / varMap^2)}{discount = mean(varPlot / varMap^2)}

And adjust the nugget:

\deqn{nugget_{new} = nugget_{old} - discount}{nugget_new = nugget_old - discount}

\strong{IQR filtering:} The variance ratio varPlot/varMap² can have extreme
values for plots with very low map variance or unusually high plot variance.
Christensen (2011) recommends filtering by the interquartile range (IQR) to
remove these outliers before calculating the mean discount factor.

\strong{Negative nugget handling:} If discounting results in a negative nugget,
the nugget is set to zero and the negative amount is added to the partial sill.
This ensures the variogram model remains valid while preserving total sill.

\strong{Interpretation:} A large discount factor indicates that plot measurement
error is a substantial component of the original nugget. After discounting, the
remaining nugget represents true micro-scale spatial variation plus any remaining
measurement error components.

# Assuming you have a fitted variogram and plot variance data:
vgm_fit <- fitResidualVariogram(
  bias_data = bias_data,
  map_sd_raster = sd_map,
  coord_cols = c("x", "y"),
  crs = "EPSG:4326"

# Calculate plot and map variances (example)
variance_data <- data.frame(
  varPlot = bias_data$sdPlot^2,  # From field measurement uncertainty
  varMap = bias_data$sd^2         # From map pixel SD
)

# Discount the variogram
vgm_discounted <- discountVariogram(
  variogram_fit = vgm_fit,
  plot_data = variance_data,
  filter_iqr = TRUE,
  iqr_mult = 1.5

# Inspect results
