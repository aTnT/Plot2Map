\arguments{
\item{plot_data}{data.frame, Plot dataset containing required columns. For non-aggregated mode, the
required columns are "POINT_X", "POINT_Y", "AGB_T_HA_ORIG", "AGB_T_HA", and "SIZE_HA".
For aggregated mode (when aggr is not NULL), the "varPlot" column is also required, but will
be automatically calculated if missing.}

\item{clmn}{character, Column name for plot selection (e.g., "ZONE", "CONTINENT").}

\item{value}{character, Value to select in the specified column (e.g., "Europe", "Africa").}

\item{aggr}{numeric, Aggregation factor in degrees (e.g., 0.1 for 0.1-degree cells). Set to NULL for no aggregation.
When aggregated, plots falling within the same grid cell are combined using inverse variance weighting.}

\item{minPlots}{integer, Minimum number of plots per aggregated cell. Cells with fewer plots will be excluded.}

\item{weighted_mean}{Logical, if TRUE the weighted mean is calculated considering the
approximate fraction of each cell that is covered by the roi (default is FALSE).}

\item{is_poly}{logical, Whether input plots are polygons (TRUE) or should be converted to polygons (FALSE).}

\item{dataset}{Character, the dataset to use for AGB estimation. Options are "custom", "esacci", or "gedi". Default is "custom".}

\item{agb_raster_path}{character, File path to the custom AGB raster.}

\item{forest_mask_path}{character, File path to the forest mask raster.}

\item{threshold}{numeric, Threshold (0-100) for tree cover calculation and forest masking (e.g. 0 or 10).
Only pixels with tree cover percentage above this threshold will contribute to biomass estimates.}

\item{map_year}{numeric, The year of the map data. If not provided, it will be detected automatically from the available data sources.}

\item{map_resolution}{numeric, The resolution of the map data in degrees. If not provided, it will be detected automatically from the available data sources. Used for variance calculation when aggregating.}

\item{esacci_biomass_year}{The ESA CCI BIOMASS AGB tiles year to use. Use either 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019,
2020, 2021, 2022 or "latest" (default).}

\item{esacci_biomass_version}{The ESA CCI BIOMASS AGB tiles version to use. Use either "v2.0", "v3.0", "v4.0",
"v5.0", "v5.01", "v6.0" or "latest" (default).}

\item{esacci_folder}{Directory to save downloaded ESA CCI BIOMASS AGB files. Default is the relative path "data/ESACCI-BIOMASS".}

\item{gedi_l4b_folder}{Character, the folder to save the downloaded GeoTIFF file. Default is "data/GEDI_L4B/".}

\item{gedi_l4b_band}{Character, the band to filter for. See options in the Details section below. Default is "MU".}

\item{gedi_l4b_resolution}{Numeric, the spatial resolution of the processed output GeoTIFF in degrees. The native resolution of the GEDI L4B gridded dataset is 1 km,
approximately 0.001 degrees at the equator. Default is 0.001.}

\item{timeout}{Number of seconds for reaching file download timeout.}

\item{parallel}{logical, Enable parallel processing for faster computation on multi-core systems. Default is FALSE.}

\item{n_cores}{numeric, Number of cores to use for parallel processing.}

\item{memfrac}{numeric, Memory fraction (0-1) for Terra to use in the main process. Default is 0.3.}

\item{worker_memfrac}{numeric, Memory fraction (0-1) for Terra to use in each worker process during parallel execution (future use - currently fixed at 0.2 internally). Default is 0.2.}

\item{batch_size}{integer, Number of plots to process in each batch for better memory management. If NULL (default), batch size is auto-determined based on dataset size.}

\item{crop_rasters}{logical, Whether to crop rasters to the region of interest before processing (TRUE by default).
Set to FALSE if you encounter issues with cropping or if the plots are widely dispersed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{plotAGB_\link{threshold}}{AGB values for the given forest threshold (e.g., plotAGB_10 if threshold=10).
When aggregated, these values are derived from weighted means using inverse variance weighting.
Units are in tonnes per hectare (t/ha).}
\item{tfPlotAGB}{Tree-filtered plot AGB (only when not aggregated). This is equivalent to
the AGB_T_HA values from the input data.}
\item{orgPlotAGB}{Original plot AGB, derived from AGB_T_HA_ORIG in the input data.}
\item{mapAGB}{AGB from map sampling, representing the biomass values extracted from the
reference map at each plot or cell location.}
\item{SIZE_HA}{Plot size in hectares. For aggregated cells, this is the mean plot size within the cell.}
\item{x}{X-coordinate of plot or cell center (longitude).}
\item{y}{Y-coordinate of plot or cell center (latitude).}
\item{n}{Number of plots within each aggregated cell (only included when aggr is not NULL).}
}
\description{
This function performs inverse dasymetric mapping on plot data. It selects plots
based on given criteria, optionally aggregates them, and calculates forest
fraction and Above Ground Biomass (AGB) data for each plot or cell. Inverse dasymetric
mapping is particularly useful for comparing field inventory plot measurements with remote
sensing biomass maps by accounting for differences in spatial scales and forest cover percentages.
}
\details{
The function performs inverse dasymetric mapping through these key steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Plot Selection}: Selects plots based on the specified criteria (clmn and value).
\item \strong{Spatial Processing} (two modes):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Non-Aggregated Mode} (aggr = NULL): Each plot is processed individually.
\itemize{
\item Tree cover percentage is calculated for each plot
\item Biomass values are adjusted based on tree cover percentage
}
\item \strong{Aggregated Mode} (e.g., aggr = 0.1): Plots are grouped into grid cells.
\itemize{
\item New grid cell coordinates are calculated using integer division
\item Plot measurements are aggregated using inverse variance weighting
\item Cells with insufficient plot counts (less than minPlots) are filtered out
}
}
\item \strong{Forest Cover Correction}:
\itemize{
\item Tree cover percentage is calculated for each plot or cell
\item Only forest pixels (based on threshold) contribute to biomass estimates
}
\item \strong{Map Comparison}:
\itemize{
\item AGB values are sampled from reference maps
\item Enables direct comparison between field-measured and map-estimated biomass
}
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Ensure all required columns are present in the input plot data.
\item For parallel processing, adjust \code{n_cores} based on your system's capabilities.
\item Large datasets may require significant processing time and memory.
\item When using aggregation, the function automatically calculates \code{varPlot} if missing.
