\title{Adjust AGB map by removing predicted bias}
\usage{
adjustMapBias(
  map_agb,
  bias_map,
  forest_mask = NULL,
  threshold = 10,
  scale_factor = NULL,
  return_totals = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{map_agb}{SpatRaster object containing the original AGB map to be adjusted.
Values should be in Mg/ha. This is typically the same map used in earlier
steps of the bias modeling workflow.}

\item{bias_map}{SpatRaster object containing predicted bias from
\code{\link{predictBiasMap}}. Must have the same extent, resolution, and CRS
as \code{map_agb}. Values in Mg/ha.}

\item{forest_mask}{Optional SpatRaster object for forest masking, typically a
tree cover layer. If provided, used together with \code{threshold} to define
forest areas for regional total calculations. If NULL (default), no masking
is applied.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value (0-100) specifying the minimum tree cover percentage
to be considered forest. Only used if \code{forest_mask} is provided. Default
is 10 (i.e., areas with <10\% tree cover are excluded). Set to 0 to include
all areas with any tree cover.}

\item{scale_factor}{Numeric value for scaling pixel-level values to regional
totals. Typically calculated as (resolution_in_meters^2) / 10000 to convert
from per-hectare to total. If NULL (default), automatically calculated from
raster resolution assuming input resolution is in degrees.}

\item{return_totals}{Logical indicating whether to calculate regional totals.
Default is TRUE. If FALSE, only the adjusted raster is returned without
total calculations.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_totals = TRUE}, returns a list with:
\describe{
\item{adjusted_map}{SpatRaster with bias-adjusted AGB values (Mg/ha).
Calculated as: adjusted = original - predicted_bias}
\item{default_total}{Numeric, total AGB from original map in Mg (if return_totals=TRUE)}
\item{adjusted_total}{Numeric, total AGB from adjusted map in Mg (if return_totals=TRUE)}
\item{difference}{Numeric, difference between adjusted and default totals in Mg.
Positive values indicate the adjusted estimate is higher.}
\item{percent_change}{Numeric, percentage change from default to adjusted.
Formula: 100 * (adjusted - default) / default}
\item{n_cells}{Integer, number of cells included in totals calculation (after masking)}
}
If \code{return_totals = FALSE}, returns only the adjusted_map SpatRaster.
}
\description{
This function adjusts an AGB map by subtracting the predicted bias, optionally
applies a forest mask, and calculates regional totals for comparison. This allows
to provide bias-corrected AGB estimates at both pixel and regional scales.
}
\details{
The bias adjustment follows a simple subtraction approach:
\deqn{AGB_{adjusted} = AGB_{original} - bias_{predicted}}{AGB_adjusted = AGB_original - bias_predicted}

Where \code{bias_predicted} is the output from \code{\link{predictBiasMap}}.
Areas where the model predicted positive bias (map overestimation) will have
their AGB reduced. Areas with negative bias (map underestimation) will have
their AGB increased.

Regional totals are calculated by summing all pixel values (after forest masking)
and multiplying by the scale factor to convert from per-hectare to total biomass.
The scale factor accounts for pixel size:

\deqn{Total = \sum (AGB_{pixel} \times PixelArea)}{Total = sum(AGB_pixel * PixelArea)}

For example, with 0.1-degree pixels at the equator (~11km), the scale factor
would be approximately (11000^2) / 10000 = 12100.

# Following from predictBiasMap example
# Assuming map_agb and bias_map are already created

# Simple adjustment without masking
adjusted <- adjustMapBias(
  map_agb = map_layer,

plot(adjusted, main = "Bias-Adjusted AGB (Mg/ha)")

# Adjustment with forest mask and regional totals
result <- adjustMapBias(
  map_agb = map_layer,
  bias_map = bias_map,
  forest_mask = treecover_layer,
  threshold = 10,
  return_totals = TRUE
)

# Compare totals
print(result$default_total)
print(result$adjusted_total)
print(result$percent_change)

# Visualize difference
plot(result$adjusted_map - map_layer, main = "Change in AGB (Mg/ha)")
